# Gmod-Map-Maker-Tool
I've decided to make the addon public, so that anyone can edit the code. If you want, send your modifications my way and if i deem them appropiate i will update the base addon with your changes.
You can send me your code to lordmarum@gmail.com or pushing your builds to the Community branch. Keep a copy on your computer, you never know if it will be accidentaly overwritten.
